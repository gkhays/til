### Comments in Markdown  
I ran across something like the following in a `README`:  
```markdown  
[//]: # (currently not being used)  
[//]: # (echo '{"url":"","path":""}' > test.json)  
```  
Apparently the above is a comment style. Personally, I have used `HTML`, e.g.  
```html  
<!-- This is my coment -->  
<!--# Add pound symbol to highlight in the visual editor -->  
```  
From StackOverflow:  
```markdown  
[comment]: <> (a reference style link.)  
[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)  
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)  
```
