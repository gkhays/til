# Alternative to Escape Key

I'm definitely a fan of modal operations in Vim but the Escape key is too far away to hit without taking my fingers off the home row.

I first got the idea of mapping `jj` to `<ESC>` from [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw). But followed up with some addtional articles; see below.

While in normal mode use `:inoremap jj <Esc>`. I added it to my `.vimrc`.

```vim
" Ctrl-[ is an alternative to <ESC>
inoremap jj <ESC>
```
